Consistent Naming:
Consider maintaining a consistent naming convention for keys. For instance, you have "inclusions" and "about_instructor" with underscores, but "what_to_expect" and "key_topics" with camel case. Consistency makes the JSON structure cleaner.

Additional Details:
Depending on your application's needs, you might want to include additional details such as the course's start date, duration, or a list of prerequisites. These additions can enhance the completeness of the course information.

External Links:
If there are external links related to the instructor or the course (e.g., a link to the instructor's website or course registration page), you may want to include those for better user engagement.

Localization:
If your application is intended for a global audience, consider adding support for multiple languages in the JSON. This can be done by having language-specific versions of content, allowing your application to dynamically switch between languages.

Validation Flags:
Include validation flags where necessary. For instance, you might want to ensure that the course fee is a positive number, the social media links are valid, or that specific fields are present.

Separate HTML Content from JSON:
Depending on your application architecture, you might want to separate HTML content from the JSON structure. Storing HTML content separately allows for easier management and updates without modifying the JSON structure itself.
